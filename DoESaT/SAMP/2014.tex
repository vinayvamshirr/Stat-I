\ques{5}{c}{10} For a population size 10, show that SRS without replacement the probability of drawing a specified unit at $5^{th}$ draw is equal to the probability of drawing it at the first draw.

\ques{8}{b}{15} 200 boys and 100 girls of a college appeared in an examination. Means and variances of their scores are given as below:
\begin{center}
 \begin{tabular}{|*{4}{c|}} \hline
    \textbf{Category} & No. of Students ($N_i$) & Mean Marks ($\overline{Y}_{N_i}$) & Variance ($\sigma_{N_i}^2$)  \\ \hline
    Boys & 200 & 40 & 10 \\ \hline
    Girls & 100 & 20 & 20 \\\hline
\end{tabular}   
\end{center} How will you draw a random sample of size 30 using proportional allocation? Hence obtain the variance of the estimator of the population mean.
