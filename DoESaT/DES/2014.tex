\ques{5}{d}{10} Consider RBD with 4 treatments arranged in 5 blocks. Show that RBD is orthogonal.

\ques{6}{b}{15} Consider the area under wheat for a sample of 44 clusters selected from 11 different villages. Four clusters were selected from each of the 11 villages and each cluster consists of 8 survey numbers(fields). Here sum of squares (SS) due to between villages is 2000, SS due to between clusters within villages is 8250 and Total SS is 30000. Write the ANOVA table.

\ques{6}{c}{15} Construct an LSD of size 5. Delete one column from this LSD. Prove that the resulting design is symmetrical a BIBD with parameters v=b=5, r=k=4 and $\lambda=3$.
\myline
\ques{7}{c}{15} Construct a key block of $2^7$ confounded factorial experiment into a block of size 8 by choosing suitable interactions only. Write all the independent and generalized confounded interactions. Further obtain two or more blocks using key block.

\ques{8}{a}{20} Consider a BIBD with parameters v=11=b, r=k=5 and $\lambda=2$. Obtain c matrix of the design and its non-zero eigen value. Hence obtain
\[v(\hat{t}_i - \hat{t}_m), i\neq m = 1,2,\ldots,11. \]
