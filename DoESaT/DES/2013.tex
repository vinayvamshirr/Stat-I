\ques{5}{d}{10} What do you understand by connected block design? The following is the incidence matrix of a block design with four treatments and five blocks:
\[\begin{bmatrix}
            1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0\\
            1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1\\
            0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0\\
            0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1
            \end{bmatrix}\] Compute the C-matrix of the design.

\ques{6}{a}{20} Let C be the C-matrix of a block design with parameters (v.b,r,k) and let Q be the vector of adjusted treatment totals. Show that, under usual additive fixed effects linear model E(Q) = C$\tau$ and D(Q) = C$\sigma^2$ where $\tau$ is the vector treatment effects and $\sigma^2$ is the common experimental error variance. Also show that $l^{\prime}\tau$ is estimable if and only if $l^{\prime}$ lies in the row space of C.

\ques{7}{a}{20} Show that for a BIBD with v=nk and n, a positive integer, b$\geq$v+r-1. Show that for a symmetrical BIBD with v even, r - $\lambda$ is a perfect square.
