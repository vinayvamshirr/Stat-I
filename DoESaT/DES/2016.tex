\ques{6}{b}{15} Let $N$ be the incidence matrix of a BIBD of order $b\times v$. Show that $b\geq v$.
\myline
\ques{7}{b}{15} Prove that the necessary and sufficient condition for a design to be connected is $n\geq b+v-1$, $n$ being the number of observations
\myline
\ques{8}{c}{15} Construct $(2^5,2^2)$ design with minimum number of replicates achieving balance over 3-factor and 4-factor interaction effects without confounding any main effect and 2-factor interaction effect.
