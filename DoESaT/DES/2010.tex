\ques{5}{f}{12} Explain in detail, the procedure of randomization (i.e., allocation of treatments randomly to plots) followed in randomized block design and Latin square design.

\ques{6}{b}{20} Distinguish between $2^3$- and $3^2$- factorial experiments. Explain, how you will get sum of squares due to main and interactions in $3^2$-factorial experiments.\\
Give format of ANOVA table for $3^2$-factorial experiment mentioning degrees of freedom if randomized block design having r blocks containing 9 plots is used. 
\myline
\ques{7}{c}{20} In a randomized block design with $k$ treatments and $r$ replications, two observations are missing. One missing observation is related to $i^{th}$ treatment in the $j^{th}$ block and the other is related to the $\alpha^{th}$ treatment in the $\beta^{th}$ block ($i\neq \alpha$ and $j\neq\beta$). How well will you estimate the missing observations? Derive the expressions for the estimate of missing observations.
