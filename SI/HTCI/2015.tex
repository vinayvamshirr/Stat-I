\ques{1}{d}{10} Let $X_1,X_2,\ldots,X_m$ and $Y_1,Y_2,\ldots,Y_n$ be independent random samples from $\mathcal{N}(3,\sigma_1^2)$ and $\mathcal{N}(2,\sigma_2^2)$ respectively. Find a confidence interval for $\dfrac{\sigma_1^2}{\sigma_2^2}$ at confidence level $1-\alpha$.

\ques{2}{c}{15} The distribution under the null hypothesis of $X$ is uniform over $1,2,\ldots,10$ and under the alternative hypothesis, the distribution is given by $P\{X =k\} = 0$, for k=1,2,3,4, $P\{X=k\} = \dfrac{1}{8}$ for k = 5,6,7,8,9 and $P\{X=10\} = \dfrac{3}{8}$. Obtain most powerful test of size 0.15 and find its power, based on a sample size of one.

\ques{3}{a}{20} A trial can result in one of the three possible outcomes with probabilities $p_1,p_2 \text{ and } p_3 \enskip(p_1+p_2+p_3 = 1)$ respectively. Construct the Likelihood Ratio Test of $H_0:p_1=p_2=\dfrac{1}{3}$ against the alternative that these probabilities are different from $\dfrac{1}{3}$. The test needs to be constructed on the basis of n-trials.

\ques{3}{c}{15} Find a Most Powerful test for testing \[H_0:f(x) = \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\dfrac{1}{2}x^2}, -\infty < x < \infty \]
versus \[ H_1:f(x)=\dfrac{1}{2}e^{-|x|}, -\infty<x<\infty \] on the basis of a random sample of size n. Here $f(x)$ is the p.d.f. of the random variable X.
