\ques{1}{d}{10} Let $X$ be a negative Binomial random variable with parameters $r$ and $\theta$, $r$ being known and $\theta$ unknown. Suppose the problem is to test $\text{H}_0 : \theta = \frac{1}{2}$ against $\text{H}_1 : \theta > \frac{1}{2}$. Find the UMP for the problem and obtain its power function.

\ques{3}{b}{15} For one parameter exponential family obtain UMPU test for testing $\text{H}_0 : \theta = \theta_0$ against $\text{H}_0 : \theta \neq \theta_0$. Further prove that \[ E\left[\varphi(X)T(X)\right] = \alpha E\left[T(X)\right] \]
