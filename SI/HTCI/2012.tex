\ques{3}{b}{20} When will Neyman-Pearson test and likelihood ratio test be the same? Obtain the likelhood ratio test for testing $H_0 : p = p_0$ against $H_1 : p \neq p_0$ based on a random sample from the binomial, $b(1,p)$.

\ques{4}{c}{20} Describe the relationship between confidence interval estimation and testing of hypothesis. Let $X_1,X_2,\dotsc,X_n$ be a random sample from $N(\mu,\sigma^2)$, $\mu$ known. Obtain a confidence interval for $\sigma^2$.
