\ques{1}{e}{10} A tourist resort is visited by tourists from many countries. The resort operator has the following data in the month of January, 2014 : 
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|*{8}{c|}} \hline
        \textbf{Country} & USA & UK & Canada & Italy & Germany & France & Japan\\\hline
        \textbf{No. of tourists} & 22 & 12 & 18 & 10 & 20 & 18 & 30\\\hline \end{tabular}
\end{center} The resort operator has a hypothesis that the proportion of tourists visiting in the month of January of any year is $2:1:2:1:2:2:3$. Test this hypothesis at 5\% level of significance (Given $\chi_{6; 0.05}^2 = 12.59$).

\ques{4}{a}{20} Let $X_1, X_2,\ldots,X_n$ be a random sample drawn from a uniform $U(0,\theta)$ distribution. Obtain a UMP test of size $\alpha$ for testing $H_0: \theta = \theta_0$ against $H_1: \theta\neq\theta_0$.
