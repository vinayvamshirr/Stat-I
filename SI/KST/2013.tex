\ques{4}{c}{15} To compare two brands of tyres, the following milages (in '000' miles) were obtained for 8 tyres of each kind:
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ll}
         Brand A: & 32.1, 20.6, 17.8, 28.4, 19.6, 21.4, 19.9, 30.1  \\
         Brand B: & 19.8, 27.6, 30.8, 27.8, 34.1, 18.7, 16.9, 17.9
    \end{tabular}
\end{center} Test the null hypothesis at $\alpha = 0.05$ that the two samples come from the same population using the Mann-Whitney test.\\ 
$\left[\text{Table value}: U(8,8,0.025) = 50, U(8,8,0.05) = 48\right]$ where $P\left[U > U(m,n,\alpha)\right]$.
