\ques{3}{c}{15} Using Kolmogorov-Smmirnov test, determine whether the sample data givn below come from an exponential distribution with mean 4. The observations in the sampple are \\

0.7, 5.5, 5.7, 4.3, 0.8, 1.1, 5.1, 4.9, 2.0, 3.9, 5.3, 4.2, 5.2, 5.8, 6.0 \\ \\(Given, $D_{13,0.05} = 0.361, D_{14,0.05} = 0.349, D_{15,0.05} = 0.338$)
