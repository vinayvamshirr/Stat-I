\ques{1}{e}{12} Obtain a sufficient statistic for $\theta$ in sampling from
\[ f(x;\theta) = \begin{cases}\theta^x(1 -\theta)^{1-x}, \quad &x = 0,1 \\
0, & otherwise
\end{cases}\] Check if it is completely sufficient.

\ques{2}{c}{20} The random variable $X$ follows uniform distribution in $(0, \theta)$. Let $X_{(1)}$, $X_{(2)}$, $X_{(3)}$ be the order statistics in a random sample of size 3 from the population. Show that both 2$X_{(2)}$ and 4$X_{(3)}$/3 are unbiased for $\theta$.

\ques{2}{c}{20} The Random variable $X$ follows uniform distribution in $\left(0, \theta \right)$. Let $X_{1}$, $X_{2}$, $X_{1}$ be the order statistics in a random sample of size 3 from the population. Show that both $2X_{2}$ and $4X_{3}/3$ are unbiased for $\theta$.

\ques{3}{a}{20} A random sample $(X_1,X_2,\dotsc,X_n)$ is taken from the population with the probability density function
\[f(x) = \begin{cases}kxe^{-x/\theta}, \enskip & x>0, \theta >0 \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}\] where k is a constant to be suitably chosen. Derive the maximum likelihood estimator of  $\theta$. Also show that
\[ S^2 = \frac{1}{3n}\sum_{i = 1}^nX_i^2 \] is an unbiased estimator of the population variance.
