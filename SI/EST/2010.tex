\ques{1}{d}{12} A city has N taxis numbered 1 to N. A person standing at a crossing noted numbers of n taxis that pass that crossing(same taxi does not pass twice). If $M_n$ is the highest taxi number noted, find an unbiased estimate of N based on $M_n$.

\ques{1}{e}{12} Let $X_1, X_2,\dotsc, X_n$ be the lifetime of n randomly selected patients of cancer. An estimate is required for the probability that a patient survives beyond time t, i.e., $P(X>T) = S(t)$. Find the maximum likelihood estimator of $S(t)$, if the lifetime $X$ of the patients follow the following probability density function :
\[ 
\begin{aligned}
    f(x) \: &= \frac{2x}{\beta}exp(-x^2/\beta),\quad && \text{if } x > 0, \\
            &= 0, && \text{otherwise.}
\end{aligned}
\]
\ques{2}{c}{20} Explain consistency of estimators. Prove that second smallest observation in a random sample of size $n$ from the following probability density function is a consistent estimator of $\theta$ : 
\[\begin{aligned}
    f(x | \theta) \: &= exp(-(x-\theta)),\quad && \text{if} \enskip x > 0, \\
            &= 0, && \text{otherwise.}
\end{aligned}\]
\ques{4}{c}{20} $X_1, X_2,\dotsc,X_n$ is a random sample from Bernoulli population with parameter $\theta$. Consider that $\theta$ has a beta prior distribution with hyper-parameters (a,b). Obtain Bayes estimator for $\theta$ under quadratic loss function and hence obtain min max estimator for $\theta$.
