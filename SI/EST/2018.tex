\ques{3}{a}{20} Shots aimed at a target reach the plane of the target at a distance R from the centre, where R has the probability density function
\[ f_R(r;\sigma^2) = \dfrac{1}{\sigma^2}re^{-r^2/2\sigma^2};r\geq 0. \] A hit is scored if $R \leq a$. If n shots are fired and there are exactly m hits, these being at distances $r_1,r_2,\ldots,r_m$ from the centre, prove that the maximum likelihood estimator of $\sigma^2$ is given by 
\[ \hat{\sigma}^2 = \dfrac{1}{2m}\sum_{i =1}^{m}r_i^2 + \dfrac{n-m}{2m}a^2.\]

\ques{1}{b}{10} Let \Xton be a sample from  a distribution with density function \[f(x|\theta) = \theta(\theta+1)x^{\theta-1}(1 -x), 0 < x < 1, \theta>0. \] Obtain an estimate of $\theta$ by method of moments.

\ques{2}{b}{15} Let \Xton be iid binomial(1,p) random variables. Find the UMVUE for p(1-p) based on the sample.
