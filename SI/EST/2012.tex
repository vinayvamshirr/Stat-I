\ques{1}{d}{12} Assume that $X$ follow the Binomial, $B(n,\theta)$, and that the prior distribution of $\theta$ is the Uniform, $U(0,1)$. find the Bayes estimator for $\theta$ using the squared error loss function.

\ques{1}{e}{12} $X_1,X_2,\dotsc,X_n$ is a random sample from the normal distribution with 0 mean and variance $\sigma^2$. Examine the validity of the following statements :
\begin{tasks}(2)
\task $\displaystyle \sum_1^n X_i^2$ is consistent for $\sigma^2$.
\task $\displaystyle T = \frac{1}{n}\sum_1^n X_i^2$ is unbiased for $\sigma^2$.
\task $T$ is sufficient for $\sigma^2$.
\task $T$ is UMVUE for $\sigma^2.$
\end{tasks}
\ques{3}{a}{20} Based on a random sample size $n$ from the discrete Uniform distribution \[ \begin{aligned} p(x) &= \dfrac{1}{N}, \enskip &x=1,2,3,\dotsc,n\\
&=0, &\text{otherwise},
\end{aligned}\] obtain the UMVUE of $N$. Is this estimator consistent?

\ques{3}{c}{20} A random sample of size $n$ is taken from the Poisson ($\lambda$) distribution. Let $N$ be the number of observations which are equal to 0. Obtain an unbiased estimator for $e^{-\lambda}$ and improve the estimator using Rao-Blackwell theorem.
