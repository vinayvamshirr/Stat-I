\ques{4}{b}{20} Define Wald's SPRT of strength $(\alpha,\beta)$ for a simple hypothesis against a simple alternative. \smallskip\\ Derive the SPRT procedure of strength $(\alpha,\beta)$ for $H_0: \mu = \mu_0$ against $H_1:\mu = \mu_1$, based on successive observations from $N(\mu,\sigma^2)$, $\sigma^2$ known. Indicate how the test can be carried out graphically.
