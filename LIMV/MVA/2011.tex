\ques{7}{a}{20} Show that a necessary and sufficient condition for $X_p$ to be distributed as $N_p(\mu,\Sigma)$ is that every linear function $Y=l^\prime X$ is distributed as univariate normal $N(l^\prime \mu,l^\prime \Sigma l)$.

\ques{8}{b}{20} Derive the regression equation of $X_1$ on $X_2$, when $X_1$ and $X_2$ jointly follow trinomial distribution with parameters $n$, $P_1$ and $P_2$. \smallskip \\
Tube lights of a certain brand are graded as III, II or I according as they fail during the first 6000 hours and the next 6000 hours or survive the first 12000 thousand hours respectively. 12 new tube lights are put to life-testing simultaneously. 5 of them are found to be of grade III. How many of the remaining are expected to be of grade I?
