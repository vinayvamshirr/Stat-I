\ques{5}{b}{12} Examine, after deducing necessary result, if the following set of correlation coefficients are internally consistent :
\[ r_{12} = 0.62, \quad r_{13}= 0.55, \quad and \quad r_{23} = -0.42. \]
\ques{6}{b}{20} Based on a set of data $(x_i, y_{ij})$, $j = 1(1)n_i$ , $i = 1(1)p$, discuss how you would use the technique of Analysis of Variance for testing the hypothesis that the regression equation of y on x is linear.

\ques{7}{a}{20} The joint p.d.f of X and Y is given by 
\[  \begin{aligned} f(x,y)& =
\frac{n!}{x!y!(n-x-y)!}p_1^xp_2^y(1-p_1-p_2)^{n-x-y}, \quad &&x,y = 0(1)n,\: x + y \leq n,\\
&  &&0 <p_1,p_2 <1,\: p_1 + p_2 < 1, \\
 &=0, \qquad \text{other wise.}
\end{aligned} \] Find the correlation coefficient between X and Y, as also the regression equation of Y on X.

\ques{8}{b}{20} Write down the random effects model for a set of two-way classified data with one observation per cell, stating the underlying assumptions completely. What are the hypotheses that can be tested using the ANOVA technique?
 
Give the ANOVA table with explicit expressions for the different sums of squares, and the test statistics for the above hypothesis.
