\ques{1}{a}{10} We have a bag of 3 coins in it. One of them is a fair coin, but the others are biased trick coins. When flipped the three coins come up `heads' with probability 0.5,0.6,0.1 respectively. If one of these coins is picked at random and flipped three times,
\begin{enumerate}[topsep=0pt, itemsep = -1ex,label=(\roman*)]
    \item What is P(HHT)?
    \item Assuming that [HTT] occurred, what is the probability of having chosen a fair coin?
\end{enumerate} Here [H,T] denote Heads and Tails respectively.
