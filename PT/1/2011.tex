\ques{1}{1}{12} Of the under-5 children in a locality, 20\% are malnourished but not immunized, while 40\% are immunized but not malnourished. If 30\% are neither immunized nor malnourished, what percentage of the under-5 children of the locality are malnourished?

\ques{1}{b}{12} For a discrete random variable X
\begin{equation*}
    P\{X>r\} = \left(1 - \frac{1}{n}\right) \left(1 - \frac{2}{n}\right)\dots \left(1 - \frac{r}{n}\right), \quad r=1,2,\dots
\end{equation*}
Find the probability mass function of $X$.
