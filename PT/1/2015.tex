\ques{1}{a}{10} Let the probability that a family has exactly n children be $\alpha p^n(\alpha >0, 0 < p <1)$. Assume that a child can be a boy or a girl with equal probability. \begin{tasks}
\task Obtain the probability that a family has exactly k $(\geq 1)$ boys.
\task Given that a family has at least one boy, what is the probability that there are two or more children in that family?
\end{tasks}
\ques{4}{a}{20} Let F($\cdot$) be the cumulative distribution function (CDF) given by \[ F(x) = \begin{cases}
             0,\quad &if\quad x<1\\
             \frac{1}{2} + \frac{(x-1)}{4},\quad &if\quad 1\leq x<2\\
             \frac{7}{8} + \frac{(x-2)}{8},\quad &if\quad 2\leq x<3\\
             1,\quad &if\quad x\geq 3.
    \end{cases}\] Find the set of discontinuity points of F and express F as a mixture of its discrete and continuous parts.
