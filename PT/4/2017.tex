\ques{1}{c}{10} Let ${X_n}$ be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables with common probability function \[ P[X=-n] = P{X=n] = \dfrac{3}{\pi^2n^2}, \enskip n=1,2,\ldots}\] Check whether $X_n$ obeys \textit{(i)} the strong law  of large numbers and \textit{(ii)} the weak law of large numbers.

\ques{2}{b}{15} State and prove Chebyshev's inequality. Hence or otherwise, prove that \textit{(i)} $P\left[ X \leq \dfrac{\lambda}{2} \right] \leq \dfrac{4}{\lambda}$ and \textit{(ii)} $P[X \geq 2\lambda] \leq \dfrac{1}{\lambda}$, if $X$ is any positive random variable having both mean and variance equal to $\lambda$.
