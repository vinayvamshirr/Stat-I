\ques{4}{b}{15} State the strong law of large numbers. Decide whether the strong law of large numbers holds for sequences of mutually independent random variables $X_k$ with distribution \[ \begin{aligned}
    &P \left\{ X_k = \pm 2^k \right\} = 2^{2k -1} \\
    &P \left\{ X_k = 0\right\} = 1 - 2^{-2k}.
\end{aligned}
