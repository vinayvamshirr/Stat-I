\ques{1}{c}{12} Suppose every packet of the biscuit NICE contains a coupon bearing one of the letters N, I, C, or E with equal probability. A customer who has all the four letters, wins a free packet. A housewife buys 8 such packets. What is the probability that she wins \emph{(i)} one free packet and \emph{(ii)} two free packets?

\ques{3}{c}{20} The joint probability density function of $X,Y$ is given by 
\[f(x,y) = \begin{cases} x\left(x + \dfrac{y}{3}\right), \enskip &0<x<1,0 < y < 2 \\
0, & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} \] 
Compute (i)$P(C>\frac{1}{2}$, (ii) $P(Y<X)$ and (iii) $P(Y<\frac{1}{2}| X < \frac{1}{2})$.\\\\
Also derive the regression equation of $Y$ on $X$.
