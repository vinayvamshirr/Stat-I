\ques{1}{a}{10} In the course of an experiment with a particular brand of DDT on flies, it is found that 80\% are killed in the first application. Those which survive develop a resistance, so that the percentage of survivors killed in any later application is half that in the preceding application. Thus 40\% of survivors of the first application would succumb to the second, 20\% of survivors would succumb to the third, and so on. \smallskip \\
Find the probability that \begin{tasks}
\task a fly will survive four applications
\task it will survive four applications, given that it has survived the first one.\end{tasks}
\ques{1}{b}{10} The joint distribution of two random variables $X$ and $Y$ has the p.d.f. \[ \begin{aligned} f_{X,Y}(x,y) &= \beta^{a+b}x^{a-1}(y-x)^{b-1}e^{-\beta y}, \enskip&&0<X<Y<\infty \\
& = 0, && \text{otherwise}
\end{aligned}\] Derive the marginal distribution of $X$ and the conditional distribution of $Y$ given $X$.
