\ques{1}{b}{12} A bivariate random vector $(X,Y)$ is specified by 
\[ P(X>x, Y >y) = e^{-(x+y+\theta xy)}; \quad x,y >0, \enskip 0\leq\theta\leq 1.\]
Obtain (i) the p.d.f. (ii) the marginal p.d.f's and (iii) the conditional p.d.f's. When will X and Y be independent?

\ques{2}{a}{20} Define exponential family of distributions. Identify two distributions each which (i) belongs to the family and (ii) does not belong to the family. Substantiate your answer.

\ques{2}{b}{20} For a continuous non-negative random variable $X$ with $E(X) < \infty$, show that for $t >0$, \[ E\left(X-t \middle | X > t \right) = \dfrac{1}{\overline{F}(t)}\int\limits_t^\infty \overline{F}(x)dx, \] where $\overline{F}(x)=P(X>x)$. Evaluate the conditional expectation for the exponential model specified by \[\overline{F}(x)=e^{-x/\lambda}; \enskip x>0. \]
