\ques{1}{a}{10} A box contains $N$ tikets numbered 1 t $N$. A boy draws $n$ tickets from the box randomly. IF $X_1,X_2,\ldots,X_n$ be the numbers of tickets drawn, what is $E[\text{max }X_i]$

\ques{1}{c}{10} If $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ be two independent standard normal variables, show that the distribution of the ratio $\dfrac{Z_1}{|Z_2|}$ is Cauchy with probbaility density function \[ f(x) = \dfrac{1}{\pi(1+x^2)}, \quad -\infty < x < \infty \]

\ques{2}{b}{20} You bought a box of lightbulbs from a shop. You know that the bulbs are all either short-life bulbs with mean life of 500 hours or long life bulbs with a mean life of 2500 hours, but you cannot tell which becaise there was no label on the box.\\
As you have not stopped at this shop before, you initially have no opinion as to whether you have been sold long-life bulbs or a cheaper alternative.\\ After approximately 300 hours you find that 5 bulbs are alive. Assuming that te=he life of an individual lightbulb as an exponential distribution, how would you assess the probability that you bought long-life bulbs?
